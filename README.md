# Kmeans-IRIS-Dataset
k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean , serving as a prototype of the cluster. Here we are using a dataset through which we can understand it in a better way.
